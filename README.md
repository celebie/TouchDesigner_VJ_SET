# TouchDesigner VJ SET

## TCPSyphon
I use "TCPSyphon".
TCPSyphon allows image data as TCP/IP on network to realize network transparency. Compared with AirPlay, credibility might be lower, however this trait is small latency especially customized for VJ.

## Processing
Processing project is "Minim_FFT".
Please see the file.

## TouchDesigner Project
TouchDesigner main file is "vj-santa.toe".

## OSC
I don't use "Audio File In" in TouchDesigner.
It is because, if I use the node, my TouchDesigner file often crash...
So I use ["Mr.Sano's Sound To OSC patch"](https://github.com/sanokazuya0306/soundtoosc)ï¼Ž
Thank you, Mr.Sano!

## Summary
I'm going to create other VJ Set.
Please look forward to!
